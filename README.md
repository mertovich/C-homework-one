# C-homework-one
An assignment I did to improve myself and have a little more command of the C++ language.

* Number of people who gave this movie 1 rating
* Number of people who gave this movie 2 points
* Number of people who gave this movie 3 points
* Number of people who gave this movie 4 points
* Number of people who gave this movie 5 points

Implement the Movie class, which can contain the above
information. Add a constructor that will accept two parameters and initialize the title of the movie to the value of its first parameter and the MPAA rating of the movie to the value of its second parameter and the overall rating to 0. Also include accessor member functions for title and MPAA rating. Add a member function to increase the overall rating that will only accept integer values from 1 to 5. Finally, write a member function that will return the average overall rating of a movie. Write a program to use your Movie class by first asking the user to enter the movie title and MPAA rating, then using the constructor to create an object, and then let the user enter a space-separated list of person ratings ending in -1. . Finally, the program will extract the title, MPAA rating and average overall rating of the movie.
